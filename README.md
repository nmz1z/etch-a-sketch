# etch-a-sketch
Create your own pixel art!

## Update (December 12nd, 2022)
- Added functions:
    - Fill: this was a little bit tricky. I used a recursive DFS Algorithm, although a iterative implementation should be a better choice, specially for bigger grids.
    - Eraser: right click will aplly the background color to the brush.

## Deployed (December 8th, 2022)
- Functions: Draw, Clear canvas, Toggle grid
